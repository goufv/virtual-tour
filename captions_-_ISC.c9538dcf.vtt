00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.949
Éy swáyel, Teathquathla tel skwíx.

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:07.200
Good day my name is Cortney Russell
and I am from Shxwhá:y Village.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.918
I am a current student at the University of the Fraser

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:13.129
Let's go take a look at the Indigenous Student Center

00:00:13.672 --> 00:00:18.096
S'ólh Shxwlèlí te i – This is "Our Place."

00:00:18.459 --> 00:00:19.651
There are two centres

00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:22.170
one here in Chilliwack and one in Abbotsford

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.640
Indigenous Student Centre, also known as the "ISC",

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.729
exists to create an inclusive environment for UFV First Nations, Métis, and Inuit students.

00:00:31.872 --> 00:00:34.671
The ISC staff are here to support you.

00:00:34.671 --> 00:00:38.809
If we can't directly provide what you're
looking for or fully answer your questions,

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.042
we will refer you to someone who can.

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:44.879
I'm standing in the Gathering Place, which was built in 2012

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:52.066
in consultation with local Knowledge Holders, Si:yams and Chiefs to reflect the traditional homes of the Stó:lō people.

00:00:52.913 --> 00:00:56.459
Stó:lō is a Halq'eméylem word that means river.

00:00:56.632 --> 00:01:03.683
The Stó:lō are people of the river who have lived in the territory extending from Yale to Langley since time immemorial.

00:01:04.357 --> 00:01:07.676
You can see the sunken floors  surrounded by seating.

00:01:07.676 --> 00:01:15.257
The window coverings and sliding door close the home in the evening and overnight, helping us maintain Stó:lō protocols.

00:01:15.482 --> 00:01:21.826
The design of this space reminds us that we are on the site of the oldest longhouse in S’ólh Téméxw.

00:01:21.826 --> 00:01:26.303
It was called Qoqolaxel, which means "watery eaves."

00:01:26.303 --> 00:01:30.469
The name refers to a channel built into the roof that collected water,

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:34.285
which could be released on the heads of the raiders in the middle of the night.

00:01:34.285 --> 00:01:40.076
Both locations of the Indigenous Student Center also feature Indigenous teaching gardens,

00:01:40.076 --> 00:01:44.894
and original artwork like this carving by Stan Greene, known as Ay:iye.

00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:49.082
The baby mountain goat has big eyes to watch over the Gathering Place.

00:01:49.082 --> 00:01:52.608
Its single horn reminds us that we are all unique.

00:01:52.608 --> 00:01:59.401
This house post, Eagle, was carved by Rocky LaRock, called Eyies’lek, more than 40 years ago.

00:01:59.401 --> 00:02:06.051
For many years it stood in the medical office of Dr Norman Todd, who served the Indigenous people in Chilliwack,

00:02:06.051 --> 00:02:09.486
witnessing healing and good care by the doctor.

00:02:09.486 --> 00:02:12.165
The post carries that to the ISC.

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:15.479
Often students find healing in their academic path.

00:02:15.565 --> 00:02:21.425
Plus it's a great spot to get my homework done with comfortable study spaces and a full computer lab.

00:02:21.925 --> 00:02:25.053
The Indigenous Student Centers are very special to me.

00:02:25.053 --> 00:02:28.367
It's like a home away from home where I can connect with my culture,

00:02:28.367 --> 00:02:31.128
learn from the stories of the Elders who are on hand,

00:02:31.128 --> 00:02:33.751
and meet other indigenous students from my community.
