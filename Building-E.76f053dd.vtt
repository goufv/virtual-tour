Hi! I’m Tripat Sandhu and I’m a fourth-year student studying

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.240
Criminal Justice, I also
play on the UFV women's soccer team.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.200
One of the reasons I chose to study and play at UFV is because of the excellent facilities

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.760
at the UFV athletic center and top
notch coaching and support for thirteen Cascade

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.760
's varsity teams. I also really value the
friendships I make on and off the field.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.680
I love the energy when this twenty one thousand

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.920
five hundred square foot
gymnasium is packed on game day

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.960
with students screaming “Go Cascades Go!”,
I can't wait till we play again.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.320
Building E also home to UFV's Campus Recreation, Which

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.480
offers intramural sports and fitness

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.920
classes to the UFV community.
During covid restrictions

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.320
you can stay fit and workout with your

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.520
friends through online classes offered
through UFV's campus rec.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.200
That's a really important part of
practicing wellness during the pandemic.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.760
I hope you enjoyed my tour.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.720
If you're an athlete,
consider becoming a cascade like me.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.920
See you at the gym.
