Hi guys, my name is Navjot Kaur Gill, and I am studying at the University of the Fraser Valley;  

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:11.055
and I am studying Criminal Justice Diploma. So let me show you Building B!

00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:17.520
My name Tejsvi Soni,  and I am an international student here at UFV. So this is the home to many of UFV Student  

4
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.400
Services. This is where you can ask questions about admissions, registration and financial aid.  

5
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.200
During Covid-19, all these services are available online, and I still get lots of support from UFV  

6
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.200
staff & Faculty. Here is home to Global Student Lounge. This is one of my favourite places to  

7
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.040
study, hangout with friends or just take a break. Student clubs and intercultural peer support  

8
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.440
programs, like Friends without Borders, also meet here. Right now, peer support services are meeting  

9
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.760
online, but that doesn't stop us from building meaningful friendships with other students  

10
00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.040
from around the world – just from the comfort of our living rooms. I've enjoyed the diverse  

11
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.561
and supportive culture here at UFV, 
and I know you will too.
