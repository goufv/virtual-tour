Hi! I'm Chandy Dancey, a fifth-year biology
student at the University of Fraser Valley.

2
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:12,110
Today I'm going to show you A Building, home to our fully equipped science labs and where I spend a lot of my time.

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,340
Did you know that UFV is one of the most lab-intensive university science programs in BC? That's right!

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:22,270
Here, we get interactive, hands-on practice in laboratory and research skills.

5
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:26,570
I also love that as an undergrad. I can apply for research positions, co-author 

6
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:31,680
scientific papers and present research findings at scientific conferences. Come explore the 

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,950
 frontiers of science at UFV!
