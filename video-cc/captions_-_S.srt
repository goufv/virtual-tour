Hi. I’m Alec, a fourth year studying Philosophy here at the University of the Fraser Valley.  

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,520
When I am not in class, you can find me right here in Building S. Let me show you around.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,680
First stop is the UFV Career Centre. Here, you can book a virtual session 

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,040
with a Career Coach to get help with your resume and tips on how to land that perfect job!

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,400
Next, is the Student Union Society or “SUS”. This student-run organization advocates for   

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,160
things like the U-Pass program and student health and dental plans. They also contribute to the 
 

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,000
popular SUS peer tutoring program - a great resource to help boost your GPA. 

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,520
Over here, we have the Student Life Department who provide peer mentorship and leadership development.  

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,640
They also connect students with clubs and associations that match their interests.

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,880
With a wide range of options, from Amnesty International to the 
Pen and Paper Tabletop Club 

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,200
to the UFV Theatre Association, I’m sure there’s a club or association you’ll want to get involved in!   

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,880
Finally, when you have some downtime, grab a coffee or lunch here at the student-run Fair Grounds 

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,760
or Streats. You haven’t lived until you’ve had the tacos!  The best part of the university is getting 

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,520
the full campus experience. So make sure to get involved and make the most of all the opportunities.
