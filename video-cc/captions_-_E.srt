Hi! I’m Tripat Sandhu and I’m 
a fourth-year student studying

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,720
Criminal Justice, I also
play on the UFV women's soccer team.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,840
One of the reasons I chose to study and play 
at UFV is because of the excellent facilities

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,320
at the UFV Athletic Center and top
notch coaching and support for thirteen Cascade

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,880
varsity teams. I also really value the
friendships I make on and off the field.

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,587
I love the energy when this twenty one thousand

7
00:00:23,587 --> 00:00:26,080
five hundred square foot
gymnasium is packed on game day

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,120
with students screaming, “Go Cascades Go!”
I can't wait till we play again.

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,400
Building E also home to UFV's Campus Recreation,

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,400
which offers intramural sports and fitness

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,840
classes to the UFV community.
During covid restrictions

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,000
you can stay fit and workout with your friends

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,800
through online classes offered
through UFV's campus rec.

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,360
That's a really important part of
practicing wellness during the pandemic.

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,880
I hope you enjoyed my tour.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,840
If you're an athlete,
consider becoming a Cascade like me.

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,320
See you at the gym.
