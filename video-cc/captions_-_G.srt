Hi there, my name is Neeraj Kumar and I study Computer Information Systems Diploma here

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,179
at University of the Fraser Valley. Today,
I am going to show you some of UFV's learning locations.

3
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,150
Now, we are in the library. This bright and

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,920
beautiful space is where you can do academic research and work on your own or with classmates.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,390
Right now, you can go online to sign-out study

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:28,160
resources using the library's "select and
collect" curbside pick-up service. The library

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,469
will even mail you the books and other resources if you are not living in the Fraser Valley

8
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:38,219
this semester. Something, I personally love about the library is their private study rooms

9
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:44,230
which you can book online and go with other classmates or go by your own. This is a computer

10
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:49,539
lab. It's fully equipped with all the IT essentials you will need to complete any coursework.

11
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:55,080
During Covid-19, you can log into the computer lab from home. It's super easy, I do like

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,079
10 times a day.

13
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:01,469
Thanks for coming on my tour of Building G. Hope to see you at UFV next semester.
