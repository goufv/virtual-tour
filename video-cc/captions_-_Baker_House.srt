Hi, my name is Lauren Dallow. I'm a Student Recruiter at the University of the Fraser Valley.

00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,800
And if you're a student who's going to be living on campus, you'll be living here at Baker House.  

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,440
I lived here for three years, It was my home away from home.  

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,240
My one piece of advice to new students would be to get involved, go to the events, make connections  

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,600
and become a part of the community. The cafeteria is where we eat, study and connect with friends. 

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,240
Try the burgers at Triple O's! This tour wouldn't be complete without a stop at the University Bookstore.

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,360
Come on in. Here's where you can grab 
your textbooks and of course a UFV sweatshirt.
